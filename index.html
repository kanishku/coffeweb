        <h4>
            A 2017 review of clinical trials found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake
            and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily.
            Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in
            pregnant women of fetal loss or decreased birth weight. Results were complicated by poor study quality, and
            differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.

        <h5>TYPES</h5>
        <p>Coffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a
            genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to
            trees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Type of bean. </b> There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica
                originates from
                Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However,
                it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade,
                humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more
                economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures
                between 65 - 97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in
                rainfall and strong sunlight.</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Type of roast. </b> Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a
                chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor associate with coffee. They are then cooled and
                ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, lighter
                the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular french
                roast is medium-dark
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Type of grind. </b> A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A
                fine grind is used for
                deeper flavors like espresso, releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Decaffeinated coffee. </b> This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from
                caffeine. The two rnost cormon

                    Quincy, Massachusetts (a suburb of Boston), but he changed the name in 1950 to Dunkin' Donuts after
                    discussing with company executives.[11][12] He conceived the idea for the restaurant after his
                    experiences selling food in factories and at construction sites, where donuts and coffee were the
                    two most popular items.</em>
